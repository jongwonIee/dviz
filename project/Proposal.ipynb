    "#6 Motivation: With just numerical results provided by libraries or Stata, unless the performer is extremely familiar with the regression process or principle, it seems hard to feel what each values mean. For example, when I write a paper with a bunch of statistical results but no visualization, it is hard for the general readers to grasp the idea of the paper. Thesis written by only economist without data experts struggle with this issue.\n",
    "(I wish I could statistically prove this problem, however it is just common problem in economics department. Professors always try to find programmers or students that can visualize better than what Stata generates. Also, students who read economic journals or thesis suffer with infinite statistics with just sentences without visualization.)\n",

    "For example, a typical article would keep listing staticis of a certain issue throughout the article. (in this case, [election](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/07/16/mainstream-election-forecasting-could-be-improved-by-a-popular-academic-approach))\n",
